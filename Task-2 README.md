# 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

# Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
# better for your growth as a system architect?

*Using AI Development Agents like Gemini CLI for repetitive setup tasks is better
for your growth as a system architect because it frees you from manual, repetitive
work and lets you focus on higher-level thinking. Instead of spending time on boilerplate
code, environment setup, or configuration, you can spend your energy on designing the 
system, planning architecture, and solving complex problems.

It also trains you to think in terms of intent you guide the AI on what you want to achieve
rather than how to do every step. Over time, this shift from execution to orchestration helps
you grow from being just a coder to a true system architect, capable of planning, managing,
and optimizing entire systems.

In short: AI handles the repetitive tasks, and you handle the big-picture decisions that
actually matter.

# Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.

*The Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer by giving them a broad and deep set of skills across AI-driven development.
Instead of focusing only on coding or one narrow area, the Nine Pillars cover everything from prompting AI, designing systems, evaluating outputs, deploying solutions, to continuously improving processes. Practicing these pillars pushes a developer to develop multiple strengths both technical depth in AI and system design, and cross functional skills like orchestration, automation, and strategy.
This combination is what makes someone M-Shaped: they are not just deep in one skill (I-shaped) or shallow in many (T-shaped), but deep in several areas and able to connect them. The Nine Pillars guide a developer to think, act, and create like a well-rounded AI-driven system architect, capable of designing, building, and optimizing complex AI solutions.
