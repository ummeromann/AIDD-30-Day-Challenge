Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
better for your growth as a system architect?

*Using AI Development Agents like Gemini CLI for repetitive setup tasks is better
for your growth as a system architect because it frees you from manual, repetitive
work and lets you focus on higher-level thinking. Instead of spending time on boilerplate
code, environment setup, or configuration, you can spend your energy on designing the 
system, planning architecture, and solving complex problems.

It also trains you to think in terms of intent—you guide the AI on what you want to achieve
rather than how to do every step. Over time, this shift from execution to orchestration helps
you grow from being just a coder to a true system architect, capable of planning, managing,
and optimizing entire systems.

In short: AI handles the repetitive tasks, and you handle the big-picture decisions that
actually matter.
