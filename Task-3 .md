# AIDD-30-Day-Challenge - Task 3

# PART A — Research Questions

# 1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
* Here are the key improvements introduced in Gemini 3.0:
Much stronger reasoning and reliability: Gemini 3.0 delivers significantly improved performance over its predecessor,
showing over 50 % better results on benchmark tasks. 
Better tool-use and multi-step/agentic workflows: It is better at following complex instructions, managing tasks that span many steps,
and using tools like code editors, CLI commands, browser automation. 
Larger context & improved multimodal understanding: Gemini 3.0 can handle larger input contexts,
is more fluent in multimodal (text + image + code) tasks, and has enhanced image generation/understanding (via the “Nano Banana Pro” variant)
including better text rendering in images and multilingual support.

# 2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
*Gemini 3.0 improves coding and automation by supporting larger context (so it can understand full projects),
generating better multi-file code, and performing multi-step tasks automatically. It also integrates with IDEs and tools,
making workflows faster, smarter, and more agent-like instead of just answering prompts.

# 3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
*Gemini 3.0 improves multimodal understanding by natively combining and reasoning over multiple input types (text, images, video, audio, code) in a unified way. 
For example:
It can analyse images and accompanying text together (e.g., a screenshot with annotations) and produce insightful responses. 
It supports larger, richer context windows, enabling complex multimodal tasks (e.g., document with images + charts + text). 
It’s built for “agentic” workflows where multimodal inputs drive multi-step actions (e.g., recognising elements in video/image and then acting). 

# 4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
*Here are two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0:
1: Gemini CLI: A command-line interface tool that integrates Gemini 3.0 to allow terminal-based workflows like shell commands, code generation, automation tasks. 
2: Google Antigravity: An agentic development platform (IDE-style) built around Gemini 3.0 where AI agents can work in the editor, terminal and browser to plan,
execute and collaborate on coding tasks.
